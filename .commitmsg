chore: cleanup docs, dead code, and fix barrel exports

Documentation:
- Rewrite README.md from HomeAuto to Split4Us
- Delete 23 session-log/completion .md files
- Keep only README.md, DEEP_LINKING_GUIDE.md, NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md

Code cleanup:
- Delete 343-line offline-support.ts (only NetworkStatus was used)
- Extract NetworkStatus to lib/network-status.ts (38 lines)
- Update OnlineStatusIndicator import path

Barrel exports:
- Add NotificationsScreen to screens/split4us/index.ts
- Remove duplicate Split4UsScreenParams type (already in types/navigation.ts)
